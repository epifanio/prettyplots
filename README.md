Design your own matplotlib stylefile interactively

Tired of playing font sizes and other matplotlib parameters every time you start a new project or write a new plotting function? 
Use [matplotlib configuration files](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html)!

Great! But how do I set them up?
Use this repo!
Start a notebook and play with the parameters, save them into a file and use it in all of your future projects!
Super simple!

### How to use?

Simple, start a notebook and follow the instructions.
You will get a 'prettyplots.mplstyle' as a result.

Add this to your code to use the stylefile:
```
plt.style.use('./prettyplots.mplstyle')
```
